# Stellar Dark Material Theme

A VS Code Theme that is a fork of `Default Material Dark Theme` by `yuchiu`.

I loved that theme so much but found that long coding sessions would fatigue my eyes because of the brighter light colors of the palette. I hand picked some dimmed variants of those lights, and even changed the hue where it made it look cool.
